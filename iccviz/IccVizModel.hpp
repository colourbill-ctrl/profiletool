/**
 * IccVizModel — data-first profile visualization model.
 *
 * Computes a profile's visualizations — tone curves, the CIE 1931 chromaticity
 * chart, named/colorant a*b* and xy scatters, and the nD CLUT lattice — and
 * *returns the underlying data* rather than finished drawings:
 *
 *   - Graph visualizations (tone curves, chromaticity, named-colour scatters)
 *     come back as Graph: 2-D point series plus axis range hints, so the caller
 *     draws/rasterizes them in its own look-and-feel. NO raster is produced for
 *     graph types.
 *   - Genuine images (the nD CLUT lattice) come back as Raster: the flattened,
 *     ICC-normalized CLUT samples plus geometry — the caller decides how to
 *     colour-manage/display them.
 *
 * Series carry a role: Primary (the profile's own data — primaries, white,
 * curve, named colours) vs Hint (reference geometry the caller may draw or
 * ignore — spectral locus, planckian curve, wavelength labels, chroma circles,
 * identity line). No ticks/grid are shipped: those are a caller-side decision;
 * only an axis range *hint* is provided.
 *
 * Design intent: this file depends ONLY on IccProfLib + spectralLocus.hpp + the
 * C++ standard library — no embind, no nlohmann, no PDF/TIFF writers — so it is
 * self-contained and portable between callers (CLI, browser/WASM, tests).

// method suggested by Harold Boll. A scalar metric (outside the Enumerate/Render
// path).

// Why seed from the device cube rather than sampling L*a*b* directly: every seed
// is then the A2B image of a real device value, so the test points are wholly
// IN-GAMUT and the round trip measures genuine B2A/A2B agreement. A directly
// sampled L*a*b* grid would place many points outside the gamut, where B2A only
// clamps them and reports a large, meaningless ΔE. Walking the device interior on
// a regular grid also spreads the seeds reasonably evenly, in terms of spacing,
// through the interior of the in-gamut region of L*a*b* space.
//
// Needs matching AToB/BToA tags for `intent` (perceptual = A2B0/B2A0, relative &

// Seeding, which is what makes the picture readable:
//   • `levels` lightness levels spanning the gamut's usable L* range.
//   • At each level, `perHue` points on the GAMUT BOUNDARY (max chroma per hue angle).
//   • Each boundary point then eroded toward neutral at chroma ×0.8, ×0.5, ×0.2.
//   • The last point of each level is replaced by neutral itself.
// So each level contributes perHue×4 points that march from the gamut surface inward,
// and the plot shows ΔE falling from the boundary to the neutral axis. Defaults
// (32 levels × 64 hues) give 8192 points — the reference's exact count.
//
// Every seed is IN GAMUT by construction, so the ΔE measures genuine B2A/A2B
// disagreement rather than clipping of unreachable colours.
//
// `x` is a monotonic pseudo-L* coordinate: within level i the points spread linearly
// from L(i) to L(i+1), so bands sit side by side and never overlap. `levelL` holds the

//     for a blue-white paper).
//   BLACK = the darkest the profile will actually go: push PCS black (L*=0,a*=b*=0)
//     through the chosen B2A table to get the inking the profile *chooses* for black,

// ── Ink usage in the shadows ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Four straight paths across the a*b* plane at ONE constant, deliberately dark L*,
// pushed through a B2A table so you can watch the separation change as the colour
// travels from far out of gamut, through the gamut, and out the other side.
//
// This is where gamut-mapping artefacts live: an abrupt step or a reversal in a
// colorant here is a visible shadow artefact in print. Because all four paths share
// one L*, any change is attributable to hue/chroma handling alone.
//
// The plane is chosen the way the reference script does: halfway between the
// profile's Blue corner and the darkest of C, M, Y, R, G — i.e. just inside the
// shadow end of the gamut. Paths run at 0° (the a* axis), 45°, 90° (the b* axis)
// and 135°, each swept across the full ±127 PCS range.
//
// BLACK POINT COMPENSATION: the perceptual and saturation tables expect PCS black at
// L*=0, so for B2A0/B2A2 the L* is first stretched from the media black point up to
// PCS black — exactly as the reference script does before those transforms. Following
// that script, the media black point always comes from B2A0 (falling back to the
// selected tag when the profile has no B2A0), so the three intents stay comparable.
// `bpcApplied` reports whether the stretch happened.
//
// Same device-space restriction as HueExtrema: the constant-L* plane is derived from
// the CMYRGB corners, so CMYK/CMY only.

// each routed from one primary corner, through the neutral axis at the L* MIDPOINT
// of its two endpoints, to the opposite corner, pushed through a B2A table so you
// can watch the separation change along the way.
//
// The counterpart to ShadowInkPaths: those paths deliberately run OUT of gamut to
// expose gamut-mapping artefacts, whereas EVERY sample here is in-gamut by
// construction (both endpoints are the profile's own primaries and the pivot is on
// the neutral axis). So a step or reversal in a colorant here cannot be blamed on
// gamut clipping — it is a CLUT-smoothness defect, the in-gamut smoothness probe the
// reference report reads visually.
//
// Same BPC convention as ShadowInkPaths for B2A0/B2A2 (each sample's L* stretched
// from the media black point up to PCS black, black point sourced from B2A0), and the
// same CMYK/CMY device-space restriction (the corners come from HueExtrema). One
// Graph per pair, x = sample index along the path (the neutral pivot sits at the
// midpoint), y = colorant %.
